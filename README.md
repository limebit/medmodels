## Why do you need MedModels?
The use of medical data in connection with AI is a rapidly growing field of research. 
However, there is a significant gap between the methodology that is published in scientific papers and the techniques that are used in the medical industry. MedModels closes this gap by offering all users an intuitive framework that provides the methods from current research publications in a directly usable manner.  


## What is MedModels 
MedModels is a Python-based software framework for the analysis of real-world evidence data for the health care sector. MedModels makes complex analyses and predictions based on medical data significantly faster, more precise, reliable, and more cost-effective. 

The vision is to combine the key expertise of research companies and science in order to gain the greatest possible benefit for patients from the data. With MedModels, we close the clear innovation gap between academic research and industrial application by providing the latest scientific methods as an application-oriented framework.
