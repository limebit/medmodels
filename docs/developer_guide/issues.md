# Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

MedModels uses GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other forms of feedback. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow these guidelines:

- **Utilize Issue Labels:** When creating a new issue, use the appropriate label from here: [https://github.com/limebit/medmodels/labels](https://github.com/limebit/medmodels/labels) to categorize your issue. This helps maintainers efficiently route and prioritize issues.
- **Leverage Issue Templates:** MedModels provides four issue templates to streamline contribution:
  - **Bug Report:** Use this template for reporting bugs or unexpected behavior encountered while using MedModels.
  - **Documentation Improvement:** This template guides you in suggesting improvements to the existing documentation.
  - **Feature Request:** Have an idea for a new feature? This template helps you outline the desired functionality and its potential benefits.
  - **Report a Security Vulnerability:** If you discover a security vulnerability in MedModels, please use this template and disclose the issue responsibly.

Following these steps will ensure your contributions are clear, well-organized, and readily addressed by the MedModels maintainers.
